# Canada-Healthcare-Spending-Model

This project analyzed annual healthcare spending in Canada, using Power Query in Excel for data processing and PowerBI for visualization. It focused on trends in healthcare spending by age group, province/territory, government versus individual expenditures on healthcare, and compared these findings to Canadian income tax brackets.

The data for this analysis were sourced from Statistics Canada and the Canadian Institute for Health Information, providing a detailed view of healthcare spending patterns across the country.

The project aimed to provide an interactive dashboard that displays clear insights into how healthcare funds are distributed and the financial impact on various groups and regions throughout Canada.
